# Garden helper

Final project for the Building AI course

## Summary
Project helps hobbygardeners to find plant proposals when giving growth zone, height, the size of the area, soil, colour or/and flowering time.It also gives the price of the plant or help garderners to exchange plants with each other for free.


## Background

I like to grow plants in garden, but it is quite difficult to find plants that are suitable to our garden. And when I find it, it takes time to find the most suitable value for money.I think there must be other hobby gardeners who just buys plant when they find it cheap or it looks so nice and at the home they wonder where to put it. Or they know what they want, but in the garden shop finds out that it is too expensive. If I have this kind of service I can do it online and save money, time and make better plans.


## How is it used?

Solution can be used by browser or may be in application. There would be a form where to put features which you want to be taken consider.


## Data sources and AI methods
Data comes from pages where is information about plants and garden shops.

## Challenges

I am not sure what kind of permission is needed when using someones webpage? Is information only from finnish pages and shops or worldwide? Maybe garden shops can help to produce plant information? If there is interface to garden shops sales systems, they can sign up, but then the material may remain small. 

## What next?

All kind of skills is needed.
